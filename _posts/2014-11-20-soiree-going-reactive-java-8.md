Jeudi 20 novembre, nous organisons une nouvelle soirée sur la programmation réactive en Java 8, à partir de 18h30 à l'Epitech, au **40 boulevard de la Marquette**.

**Going Reactive with Java 8**

Java 8's lambdas make building Reactive applications a whole lot easier and cleaner. Through copious code examples this session will show you how to build event-driven, scalable, resilient, and responsive applications with Java 8, Play Framework and Akka. On the web side you will learn about using lambdas for async & non-blocking requests & WebSockets. You will also learn how the actor model in Akka pairs well with lambdas to create an event-driven foundation that provides concurrency, clustering and fault-tolerance.

Vous retrouverez donc les sujets suivants :

* Java 8 et lambdas
* Play! framework
* Akka et ses acteurs
* Websockets
* programmation réactive
* event-driven
